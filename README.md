==========

I just started renting a nice little room in a nice little house in a nice little town.
The only issue is that I am about forty feet from the train tracks.
I haven't quite gotten used to them yet, so I'm collecting some data
to see whether I need to switch up my sleep schedule... or if I just don't get to sleep ever again.

There are two types of trains that come by.
There's Amtrak, which is surprisingly precise, though I guess that makes sense since
I'm only seeing the first and last trains of the day.

And then there are the freight trains.

Not sure why they need to going by my house at four in the morning, but apparently the lumber and
limestone slurry they're always carrying is pretty darn important. They also tend to carry disturbingly large
quantities of unscented gasoline. The freight trains are just generally a lot of fun, is my point.

Finding out when the Amtrak trains will come by is easy enough;
I'm pretty much exactly in between the two stops before and after my town, both
of which have well documented schedules. I may actually mark those down on the chart at some point.
So I'm doing this mainly as a way to see if there is any pattern in the freight trains.
And it's as a somewhat desperate attempt to maintain my sanity too, I suppose.
